Notes on various modes of modulation used for transmitting data and telemetry

I've had the worst time trying to learn how to work with data modes in 
amateur radio because documentation is either hard to read or not very 
useful. This repository is a collection of notes and experiments I've done
in order to understand how to implement data encoding schemes for my 
telemetry and satellite interests.
